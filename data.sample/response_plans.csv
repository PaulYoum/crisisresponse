He has an extensive history of suicide attempts; mostly via overdose. He lacks the coping skills and impulse control to deal with everyday problems. Gregory is very likely to attempt suicide again. When Gregory starts to get depressed, he will stop eating and drinking, he also becomes nonverbal; almost catatonic. Gregory is on an ever-changing regiment of medication to try and stabilize his condition; they have had a varying effect.

If after hours, call the Crisis Clinic for support in avoiding hospitalization. He often acts aggressively and makes suicidal statements and gestures when he is overwhelmed and frustrated.  He would benefit from MCT contact, when appropriate, to provide resources and alternatives to going to area emergency rooms. DESC staff are on board with this response plan.

Gregory called his mother Angela and stated he was going to jump off of the nearby bridge. While officers were enroute, a second person called and stated she saw a male hanging from the bridge and another male attempting to hold him back.  As officers arrived they noticed Gregory on the west side of the bridge, and wrong side of the railing.  Two people were speaking with Gregory and holding his arms through the railing.       After officers secured Gregory, SFD cut bars on the bridge to bring Gregory safely off the ledge. Gregory was emergently detained to HMC for treatment; subsequently detained by DMHPs for a 72 hour hold. CRT determined Gregory has been in and out of treatment facilities most of his childhood life.  Due to the fact Greogry is no longer a juvenile; he cannot be held in the same facilities. Gregory has no history of assaultive behavior toward others.
