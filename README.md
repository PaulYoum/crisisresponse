# Crisis Response

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/codeforamerica/crisisresponse.svg?style=svg&circle-token=3dbea1eed1c1d0e056ef0ceaeb0f54039facd079)](https://circleci.com/gh/codeforamerica/crisisresponse)

An internal tool to help the Seattle Police Department
respond to the needs of people in crisis.

## Background

The Seattle Police Department is engaging Code for America
to help develop software to divert individuals
with mental health and addiction issues
away from the criminal justice system
and connect them to health, housing, and social services.
In 2015, the Seattle police responded to 9,675 calls to 911
that involved a person
in a mental health and/or chemical dependency-related crisis.
Specialized crisis response officers review these incidents
and follow up with the most acute cases â€“
contacting the person's caseworker,
speaking to their family,
and connecting the individual with local services.
The Seattle police also train patrol officers
to respond to crisis calls
and to use de-escalation techniques
with citizens in crisis.

The Seattle fellowship team is working to develop an app
for patrol officers to use
during interactions with individuals in crisis.
Focused on tailored plans
for individuals who are frequently in contact with the police,
this tool will include information such as who to call
(family members, caseworker, etc.)
and specific action steps to help the person.

## Technical Notes

This should be everything you need to start the application from scratch.
If you run into any problems or obstacles,
please [open an issue] to help us improve the documentation.

### Dependencies

This project uses [Docker] to make it easy
to develop, package, and deploy on any platform.

Before starting, install Docker.
Their website has instructions for [mac], [windows], and [linux].

After installing Docker,
run this script to set up your development environment.
All of the dependencies are managed through Docker,
so there shouldn't be any problems running this script.
If you do encounter a problem, please [open an issue] to report it.

    % ./bin/setup

### External Connections

At the moment, the application makes no connections to external services.

Eventually, we expect the application to pull data
from the internal SPD database that powers the Records Management System (RMS).

### Running Tests

Currently, the application has no tests.

Once we move out of the initial phase, we will introduce an automated test suite
that can be used to make sure the application is functioning correctly.

### Starting the Application

With `docker-compose` installed, you can run the application with the command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

After running that command,
access the application by visiting http://localhost:8080

## Guidelines

Use the following guides for getting things done, programming well, and
programming in style.

* [Protocol](http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/protocol)

## Importing Data

There is a `data.sample` folder in the root of the repository
that is a template for the data structure that the project knows how to import.
A folder that mirrors the structure of the `data.sample` folder
can be imported by running:

```bash
bundle exec rake import[DATA_PATH]
```

...where `DATA_PATH` is the file path to the data folder that is being imported.

The `data.sample` folder contains sample response plans
that are used to seed the application.
Running `rake db:seed` is equivalent to running `rake import[data.sample]`.

As exhibited in the `data.sample` folder,
each data folder should contain a file called `response_plans.csv`,
which defines the information for the response plans in the app.
Each response plan defined in `response_plans.csv`
can have a corresponding folder in the `images` subdirectory,
which contains images for the response plan.

## Managing Application Lifecycle

```bash
# start by cloning the repository
git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/crisisresponse.git

# To set up:
docker-compose build
docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate

# To run the server
docker-compose up

# After updating the `Dockerfile`:
docker-compose build

# Push a new docker image to Docker Hub:
docker-compose build && docker push codeforamerica/crisisresponse

# After updating the `Gemfile`:
docker-compose up

# To run the server
docker-compose up
```
