# Field Tester Background Information

Hello!

Welcome to Ridealong Response.
We are really excited to have you as a field tester.
Before you jump into the app,
we wanted to cover a few key things.

1. **You are testing the app** –
    finding out what works and what does not work.
    Let us know what you think and what happens, especially when:
    * Something doesn't work (e.g. search is not functioning, etc.)
    * You have ideas about how to improve the app
  (e.g. adding more information, changes to the layout, etc.)
    * Something works really, really well
  (e.g. a piece of the app works well in your day, etc.)
1. **The app is a work in progress.**
    You’re using it at the early stages, so expect that:
    * Things will break –
      Links may not work.
      Fonts may show up in a funky way.
    * Things will change –
      The layout of information will change,
      new pieces will be added,
      etc.
1. **The app, not you, is what’s being tested.**
    If something appears in a confusing way – let us know.
    It's something we want to fix.
1. Please do **make the time to check in with us via phone**.
    Your feedback is essential to the app development process.
1. If something goes truly sideways with the app,
    **feel free to call/text us** (Meredith and Katherine) as needed.


<h2 class="red">Current Notes</h2>

This list will continually change.
**Please check this periodically**
using the menu on the top right of the screen in the app.

* As of 6/6/2016, officer safety information is not yet available.
* **Always check RMS for safety concerns**,
  even once “officer safety” is live in the app.
